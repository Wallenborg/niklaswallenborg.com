                    <h2>Warrez Culture!</h2>
                    <p><span class="capitalLetter">T</span>he Warez Culture of the 1990s was a fascinating and controversial subculture 
                    that revolved around the piracy and distribution of software, particularly on 
                    the Amiga platform. The Amiga computer, known for its advanced graphics and audio 
                    capabilities, gained a dedicated following among computer enthusiasts, but its high 
                    software prices and limited availability of legitimate titles contributed to the rise 
                    of the Warez Culture.</p>
                    <p><span class="capitalLetter">I</span>n this underground movement, individuals known as "warez d00dz" or 
                    "crackers" would break the copy protection on commercial Amiga software and distribute it 
                    through various channels, including bulletin board systems (BBSs), floppy disk exchanges, 
                    and later, the emerging world of the internet. These software pirates were often motivated 
                    by a desire to make expensive software accessible to a wider audience or to demonstrate their 
                    technical prowess.</p>
                <p><span class="capitalLetter">T</span>he Warez Culture of the 1990s was characterized by a unique sense 
                    of camaraderie and competition among enthusiasts. Groups of crackers formed "warez groups," 
                    each with its own unique branding, and they would compete to release cracked versions of 
                    popular Amiga games and applications as quickly as possible. These releases were often 
                    accompanied by elaborate intro screens and digital "cracktros" that showcased the skills 
                    and creativity of the groups involved.</p>

                <p><span class="capitalLetter">I</span>n the 1980s, a new phenomenon emerged in the world of pirated games with the advent of 
                crack intros. Before the actual game would start, these intros displayed the names of 
                the individuals responsible for creating the pirated copies, along with any messages 
                they wished to convey. Initially, these intros consisted of plain text, but over time, 
                they evolved into more elaborate presentations, incorporating GIFs, music, and vibrant 
                designs.</p>
                <p><span class="capitalLetter">D</span>uring the same era, the proliferation of bulletin board systems (BBS) from the 1980s 
                into the 1990s transformed the landscape of pirated video game sharing. Users could connect 
                their personal computers to telephone modems, dial into dedicated servers, and exchange copies 
                of video games within the burgeoning Warez scene. Notably, this system gained popularity before
                 the widespread adoption of consumer-level internet access, allowing it to operate somewhat 
                 under the radar.</p>
                <p><span class="capitalLetter">H</span>owever, as peer-to-peer torrenting technology gained traction, particularly with the release of 
                BitTorrent in 2001, the BBS-style approach to video game piracy began to wane. Today, torrenting 
                remains the preferred method for those engaged in piracy, rendering previous attempts to curb illegal 
                torrenting largely ineffective due to its decentralized nature, which makes complete dismantling 
                virtually impossible.</p>
