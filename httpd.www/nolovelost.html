      <!-- The web-page unfolds as a digital landscape, 
        resembling a garden or forest populated by early internet GIF 
        files associated with plant life and verdant symbolism. 
        "No Love Lost in the Garden of Eden" stands as an exploration 
        and tribute to the aesthetics of early internet culture,
        particularly the unsophisticated yet charming GIF animations 
        that once proliferated online. Visitors are invited to meander 
        through this digital terrain by simply scrolling through the webpage. 
        ( The GIFs are randomly placed on the web page ) -->
