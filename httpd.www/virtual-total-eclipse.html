        <meta name="description" content="www.virtual-total-eclipse.com ( of the heart ) by Niklas Wallenborg, 2020. ”I remember once when I was a kid and how I lay on the sun-drenched suburban road and stared up at the blue summer sky, I wanted to see it painted, painted black. Black as night, black as coal. Just then and there the sun was blacked out from the sky. (If the sun goes out, it will take 8 minutes before we notice anything) A solar eclipse occurs when the moon passes between the sun and the earth. It then blocks almost all the sunlight from reaching the earth for a few minutes. The next total solar eclipse will occur the year 2126 in Sweden.”">
