            <h1 class="pstartpage">Time will tear us apart and draw us together</h1>
            <p class="textleft"><b>Time</b> is a concept referring to the perceived flow of actions and events from the past to future, or to its measurement. It is strange to question the nature of <b>Time</b>, given how fundamental <b>Time</b> is to our experience. Is it possible that <b>Time</b> may not really exist, but is just an artifact of our biological and cultural evolution? <b>Time</b> is measured in the mind. It is not an event itself that is measured but the impression that it leaves on the mind. The mind expects the future, which becomes the present, which the mind attends, and then becomes the past, which the mind remembers. Memory is the human faculty by which past events and information are remembered. <b>Time</b> is not a line but a dimension, like the dimensions of space. If you can bend space you can bend time also, and if you knew enough and could move faster than light you could travel backward in <b>Time</b> and exist in two places at once. <b>Time</b> is an illusion. The first thing we should do in order to grasp the realm of <b>Time</b> travel is by redefining general perception and common concepts regarding time within our daily language structure. Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think, I think it might be us! If you see an antimatter version of yourself running towards you, think twice before embracing. You wouldn’t want to destroy the space-<b>Time</b> continuum, would you? All <b>Times</b> are connected. Someone once told me, ‘<b>Time</b> is a flat circle.’ Everything we’ve ever done or will do, we’re gonna do over and over and over again. The <b>Time</b> left is reduced … the scene of this world is changing. I was born on a Thursday. People say that a <b>Time</b> machine can’t be invented, but they’ve already invented a device that can stop <b>Time</b>, cameras are the world’s first <b>Time</b>  machines. <b>Time</b> and space travel is easily achievable using tape. The physicality of the recordings allow us to jaunt to any location and <b>Time</b>. There were times when I hade lost track of hours, even days. Sometimes, a moment settled and hovered and remained for much more than a moment. And sound stopped and movement stopped for much, much more than a moment. Than gradually <b>Time</b> awakened again and moved sluggishly on. <b>Time</b> travel occurs in humans collective subconscious. A ”<b>Time</b> loop” or ”temporal loop”. We know the thing is four months away. Technically, it’s already there and we’re four months away. One luminary clock against the sky proclaimed the <b>Time</b> was neither wrong nor right. My mind is a <b>Time</b> machine; it can travel back to the past when I close my eyes. When is now; when was then. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever. Under capitalism <b>Time</b>-keeping is not merely a means of co-ordinating and inter-relating complicated functions: it is also like money an independent commodity with a value of its own. We’re here,’ the Clock says. I recommend you to take care of the minutes. <b>Time</b> is a waste of money. <b>Time</b> was made for slaves. The past is obdurate. <b>Time</b> travel is awesome….And useful. That sentence had a typo when I typed it…The first time. I was born on a monday. If you do not move in synchronization with <b>Time</b>, you will be left behind. Was I altering the ‘space-time continuum’ or whatever they called it in <b>Time</b> travel movies, just by existing right now? The basic idea is that if you fiddle with the wormhole openings, you can make it not only a shortcut from a point in space to another point in space, but a shortcut from one moment in <b>Time</b> to another moment in <b>Time</b>. Past and future are the same. Let’s meet…yesterday! All <b>Time</b> is all <b>Time</b>. Every possible thing that can happen or will happen has already happened somewhere. We are all <b>Time</b> travelers, we just don’t know it yet. I just hope we don’t cause a major paradox. A paradox, a paradox, a most ingenious paradox. The sign comes first. It hovers high in the sky, projecting green neon light, and we believe it because we don’t have technology like that. Site of the first ever Future Faire. <b>Time</b> is the beat and the interval. It gets late early out there. The <b>Time</b> has come. What use was <b>Time</b> to those who’d soon achieve Digital Immortality? <b>Time</b> is a creation of vague mind used to describe an unknown dimension in the 3D world. The past was ”built”, the present is ”assembled” and the future – ”programmed”. The present is nothing more than a fleeting moment through which the future passes to become the past. Space and <b>Time</b> are simultaneous phenomena, and together form the fabric of the universe known as space-<b>Time</b>. There’s No <b>Time</b> Like Yesterday. <b>Time</b> is a fluid condition which has no existence except in the momentary avatars of individual people. There is no such thing as was — only is. <b>Time</b> past and <b>Time</b> future, what might have been and what has been point to one end, which is always present. <b>Time</b> flow like a river. <b>Time</b> marches on. <b>Time</b> flies. As <b>Time</b> goes by. The past is gone. <b>Time</b> waits for no one. <b>Time</b> stood still. <b>Time</b> does not flow; <b>Time</b> is like space. For one thing, what is to travel back through <b>Time</b>? Remember as we move faster and faster toward the speed of light, at the speed of light we would see everything compact into a single point and we could see everything at once. I can see everything. All that is, all that was, all that ever could be. It’s all now you see. Yesterday won’t be over until tomorrow and tomorrow began ten thousand years ago. Any <b>Time</b> travel story must contain this much: the use of some sort of <b>Time</b> travel device. The machine howled. <b>Time</b> was a film run backwards. Suns fled and ten million moons fled after them. The machine slowed; its scream fell to a murmur. The machine stopped. The sun stopped in the sky. We of course all travel through time at rate of 60 seconds per minute and 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. If <b>Time</b> were to suddenly open up… there would be no law… there would be no rule. There would only be you and your memories… Is it possible to feel nostalgic about something that had never happened. There is no future. There is no past. Do you see? <b>Time</b> is simultaneous, an intricately structured jewel that humans insist on viewing one edge at a <b>Time</b>, when the whole design is visible in every facet. <b>Time</b> is liquid. One must stand stiller than still. On reverse <b>Time</b> travel. One moment is no more important than any other and all moments quickly run away. All those moments will be lost in <b>Time</b>, like tears in rain. The past is obdurate. <b>Time</b> steps aside. Like an airplane hitting an air pocket. <b>Time</b> is relative, it can stretch and squeeze. Moving back and forth in <b>Time</b>. Closed <b>Time</b>like curve can be formed if space-time loops around. Entering such a curve tomorrow and moving forward in <b>Time</b>, we can end up at today. Where is the real here. There is no ”real here” The word ”here” just refers to whatever place the person saying it happens to be. There is no singel, real, objective ”now”. The word ”now” just refers to the <b>Time</b> at which the speaker happens to be located. Space and <b>Time</b> are combined into four-dimensional entity, space-<b>Time</b>. For all we know, <b>Time</b> travel by subatomic particles may by going on all around us. Please remember the grandfather paradox.</p>
